# Ignore files/directories that belong to the *separate* Personal Finance App.
# This assumes the 'lueprints' folder (or similar for the other app) is not within 'ficore-accounting'.
# If it is, you'd need to add its path here. This is a placeholder for safety.
# For example, if the personal finance app is in a folder named 'personal_finance_app' at the root:
# personal_finance_app/

# --- Conditional Ignores for specific tasks ---

# For the current task of implementing the AGENTS blueprint and overall integration:
# We will temporarily ignore other *feature-specific* blueprints
# This is to keep the context focused on 'users', 'agents', and overall app structure.

coins/
creditors/
dashboard/ # If 'dashboard/index.html' is meant for traders, we might need its content, but the folder can be ignored if only users/dashboard.html is used.
